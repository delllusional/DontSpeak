//! Claude Code hook dispatch behind the two stdio entries (`dontspeak notify` /
//! `dontspeak provide`). The whole interaction is just "event name + payload JSON in →
//! optional JSON out".
//!
//! The split is by CONTRACT (command vs query), not by event:
//!   • [`notify`]  — COMMAND: the client notifies us of an event; we run the side effect
//!                   and reply with NOTHING. Fire-and-forget, never blocks, errors ignored.
//!                   (MessageDisplay, SessionStart, SessionEnd, UserPromptSubmit→mark-active,
//!                   and Stop→speak-the-final-reply for non-streaming clients like Codex.)
//!                   These are wired `async`, so Claude Code discards their stdout — fine, they
//!                   reply with nothing.
//!   • [`provide`] — QUERY: Claude Code asks us for input and WAITS; we return JSON it renders.
//!                   (UserPromptSubmit → the narration spec.)
//!
//! A single CC event can ride BOTH (UserPromptSubmit marks the terminal active AND provides
//! the spec) — they're two different interaction kinds that happen to share the event.
//!
//! The SessionStart GREETING is voice-only. A visible banner used to ride a synchronous
//! `provide` twin, but CC 2.1+ drops a SessionStart hook's `systemMessage` and the
//! `terminalSequence` OSC notification only fires on terminals that implement it — so it
//! never reliably surfaced and was removed. The greeting is just the engine voice greet.
