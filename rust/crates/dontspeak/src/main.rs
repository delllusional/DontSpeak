//! `dontspeak` — the single multi-call binary. With NO args (this file's default role)
//! it is a stdio Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes the DontSpeak engine's
//! TTS/STT to MCP clients (Claude Code, Claude Desktop). With a subcommand it is instead
//! a Claude Code hook executor or installer step — see the front-door dispatch in `main`
//! and the `hook_speak` / `hook_narrate` modules (the former `ds-speak` /
//! `ds-narrate` binaries, now folded in here).
//!
//! As the MCP server it is a THIN BRIDGE: it speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over
//! stdio on one side (the MCP spec, revision 2025-11-25) and the existing `ds-ipc`
//! Unix-socket protocol to the resident `dontspeakd` on the other — so MCP is just another
//! client of the SAME engine the hooks and SwiftUI app use (one warm owner, in sync).
//!
//! Tools (the authoritative catalog — names, schemas, descriptions — lives in
//! `ds_tools::catalog()`; this is just an orientation): speak, stop_speech,
//! listen, get_status, list_voices, diarize, manage_speakers, set_config,
//! setup_integration.
//!
//! `list_voices` is config-DIRECT: it reads DontSpeak's own settings file
//! (`our config.toml`) to mark the active voice, so it needs no engine
//! round-trip and works even with no engine running. The voice itself is a
//! persistent setting: all config writes (the spoken voice included) go through
//! `set_config` (same file; the engine hot-reloads on its mtime) — config is the
//! single source of truth, so there is no transient per-session voice override.
//!
//! Transport rules (spec): stdout carries ONLY JSON-RPC messages, one per line;
//! ALL logging goes to stderr. Each request gets exactly one response (matched by
//! id); notifications (no id) get none.
//!
//! ## Module layout
//! `main.rs` is just the front door (subcommand dispatch). The MCP server core lives in
//! [`mcp`] (envelope helpers + [`mcp::dispatch`] + the `initialize`/`tools` methods),
//! the tool handlers in [`tools`], voice/language enumeration in [`voices`], the engine
//! spawn lifecycle in [`engine_launch`], and the `prompt-context` hook in [`hook_prompt`].
// Windows: GUI subsystem so NO console window appears when a GUI host (Claude
// Code / the WinUI app) spawns this stdio server. stdin/stdout still work over the
// inherited pipes the MCP client provides.
