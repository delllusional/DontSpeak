//! Platform abstraction for the dontspeak engine.
//!
//! Three capability traits split the OS-specific surface the engine needs:
//!   * [`KeyInjector`]     — synthesize the dictation key tap (down+up) that toggles recording.
//!   * [`FrontmostWindow`] — is a terminal the frontmost app? (focus gate)
//!   * [`CapsKeyMonitor`]  — physical Caps key down/up edges (the gesture source) + the
//!     Caps LED write (driven as a pure output).
//!
//! [`Platform`] aggregates all three plus a one-time `preflight()` (permission
//! check). The free functions [`current()`] (the platform impl for the build
//! target) and [`mic_active()`] (system mic-in-use probe) dispatch to the per-OS
//! modules. The OS-independent [`KeyChord`]/[`KeyBase`] keybinding parser lives in
//! the `chord` module.
//!
//! All three ports are implemented, each behind its `cfg(target_os=…)`, and are
//! built + tested per-OS in CI (the release full matrix: Linux, Windows, macOS;
//! per-commit CI covers Linux only).
